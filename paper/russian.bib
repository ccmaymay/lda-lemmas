	curated stopword list. Constructing this list is time-consuming and often
	subject to user judgments about what kinds of words are important to the model
	and the application. Although stopword removal clearly affects which word types
	appear as most probable terms in topics, we argue that this improvement is
	superficial, and that topic inference benefits little from the practice of
	removing stopwords beyond very frequent terms. Removing corpus-specific
	stopwords after model inference is more transparent and produces similar
	results to removing those words prior to inference.},

In this work, we train and evaluate topic models on a variety of corpora using several different stemming algorithms. We examine several different quantitative measures of the resulting models, including likelihood, coherence, model stability, and entropy. Despite their frequent use in topic modeling, we find that stemmers produce no meaningful improvement in likelihood and coherence and in fact can degrade topic stability.},
