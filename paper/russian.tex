\title{Topic Modeling for Morphologically Rich Languages}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Topic modeling is a standard tool for unsupervised analysis of large
text corpora. At the core, almost all topic models pick up on
co-occurrence signals between different words in the corpus, that is,
words that occur often in the same sentence, are likely to belong to
the same latent topic. In languages that exhibit rich inflection
morphology, the signal becomes weaker given the proliferation of
unique tokens. In this work, we explore the effect of token-based
lemmatization on the performance of topic models.

Syntactic information is not generally considered to exert a strong
force on the thematic nature of a document.  Indeed, for this reason
topic models often make a bag-of-words assumption, the whereby exact
order of the words in a sentence is discard. In morphologically rich
languages, however, syntactic information is often encoded in the word
form itself. Nevertheless, most commonly employed approaches to topic
modeling ignore the influence of morphology. Consider the Russian name
{\em Putin}; in English, we have a single type that represents in the
concept in all syntactic contexts, whereas in Russian
{\selectlanguage{russian} Путин} appears with various inflections,
e.g., {\selectlanguage{russian}Путина},
{\selectlanguage{russian}Путину}, {\selectlanguage{russian}Путине},
and {\selectlanguage{russian}Путином}. Which form of the name one uses
is fully dependent on the syntactic structure of the sentence. Compare
the utterances {{\selectlanguage{russian}мы говорим о Путине} ({\em we
    are speaking about Putin}) and {{\selectlanguage{russian}мы
      говорим Путину} ({\em we are speaking to Putin})}, both sentence
  are thematically centered on Putin, but two different words forms
  are employed.

    fitler these endings as well?}
  
\section{Morphology and Lemmatization}\label{sec:inflectional}
Morphology concerns itself with the internal structure of individual
words.  Specifically, we focus on {\em inflectional morphology}, word
internal structure that marks syntactically relevant linguistic
properties, e.g., person, number, case and gender on the word form
itself. While inflectional morphology is minimal in English and
virtually non-existent in Chinese, it occupies a prevalent position in
many languages' grammars, e.g., Russian. In fact, Russian will often
express relations marked in English with prepositions, simply through
the addition of a suffix, often reducing the number of words in a
given sentence.  \ryan{Need to say more?}

In the context of NLP, heavily inflected inflected languages have an
increased token to type ratio, greatly increasing the number of
unknown owords. One method to combat is to {\em lemmatize} the sentence.
A lemmatizer maps each inflection of a word, to a canonicalized form.

    {\bf Genitive} &  {\selectlanguage{russian}пса} ({\em psa}) & {\selectlanguage{russian}псов}    ({\em psov})  \\

    {\bf Instrumental} &  {\selectlanguage{russian}псом} ({\em psom}) & {\selectlanguage{russian}псами}  ({\em psami}) \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A declension table for the Russian word
    {\selectlanguage{russian}пес} ({\em pyos}), meaning ``dog''.  Each
    of the 12 different entries in the table occurs in a distinct
    syntactic context. A lemmatizer canonicalizes these forms to
    single form, which is the nominative singular in the case of
    Russian, greatly reducing the sparsity present in the corpus.  }

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}
\ryan{I can probably do the non-topic-modeling part of this section.}

Though applied in many
studies~\cite{deerwester1990,hofmann1999,mei2007,nallapati2008,lin2009},
lemmatization has not been directly explored in the context of topic
modeling.  An infinite-vocabulary LDA model containing a prior on words
similar to an n-gram model has been developed~\cite{zhai2013}; this
prior could be viewed as loosely encoding beliefs of a
concatenative morphology, but its effect was not analyzed in
isolation.


\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

To measure the effect of lemmatization on topic models we must first
define a topic model.  In this study, for comparability with other
work, we restrict our attention to latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA)~\cite{blei2003}, the canonical Bayesian graphical topic model.
However, we want to measure the performance of a topic model by its
interpretability, as topic models are surpassed by other models,
including traditional vector space models, in tasks without a ``human
in the loop''~\cite{may2015}.  Thus we note there are more modern but
less widely-used topic models such as the sparse additive generative
(SAGE) topic model, which explicitly models the background word
distribution and encourages sparse topics~\cite{eisenstein2009}, or the
nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) topic model, which
represents topics in a hierarchy and automatically infers its effective
size~\cite{paisley2015}.  These models may render more interpretable
results overall.  However, we are currently interested in the
\emph{relative} impact of lemmatization on a topic model, we are
unaware of any direct prior work, and we wish for our results to be
widely applicable across research and industry.  Thus we leave these
alternative topic models as considerations for future work.

We must also determine how to measure the quality of a
topic model.  In particular, in this study we require an evaluation
metric that is comparable across different views of the same corpus.
Additionally, we desire an evaluation metric that correlates with a
human's ability to use the model to explore or filter a large dataset,
hence, the interpretability of the model.  Thus we evaluate models in
this study by \emph{word intrusion} performance.  In the word intrusion
evaluation, a human judge is given one topic at a time, represented
by its top $m$ words (for some small number $m$) in random order, as
well as an additional word, called the \emph{intruder}, randomly placed
among the $m$ topic words~\cite{chang2009}.
The intruder is randomly selected from the set of high-probability
words from other topics in the model.
The judge is tasked with identifying the intruder in each list of
$m + 1$ words (where each list corresponds to a topic from the model).
If the model is interpretable, the $m$ words from a topic will be
internally coherent whereas the intruder word is likely to stand out.
Thus a model's interpretability can be quantified by the fraction
of topics for which the judge correctly idenfies the intruder, called
\emph{model precision}~\cite{chang2009}.
